This project is a small Student Database demo that uses PostgreSQL and Python.

The program contains functions that can:

The SQL functions are in A3.1.sql, and the Python code that calls them is in Comp3005_A3.py.

Setup:

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running.

- Create or use a database

- Run the SQL file: psql -d COMP_3005_A3 -f A3.1.sql

- Install Python dependency:

- pip install psycopg2

- Run the Python file:
